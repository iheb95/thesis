csi movies
create images dataset and downscale them
use cnn to train them
use mean square error to optimize (is it the right method?)
structural similarity as loss function
pre trained models
using GANs or SRGAN uses VGG loss function
balance between mean square error and ESRGANs using VGG

tv regularization
auto encoder
do litterature research
spend a month on it
short presentation
total variation to bring in loss function, works with tv regu
what is a good loss function?
